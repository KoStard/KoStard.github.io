      <title>Meaninglessness</title>
      <link>https://kostard.github.io/blog/2023/06/meaninglessness/</link>

      <guid>https://kostard.github.io/blog/2023/06/meaninglessness/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Whenever I had ideas about the world or a thing I wanted to do, I would quickly disregard them saying that it&amp;rsquo;s not objectively valuable, so I need something better, stronger, more meaningful, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then after a few years of continuous spiraling, I asked this &lt;a href=&#34;../the-simple-questions&#34;&gt;simple question&lt;/a&gt;:
&amp;ldquo;Is there anything objectively valuable?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This led me through a chain of thoughts coming after each other, that eventually resulted in this experiment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine you are the only living organism in the universe. Just a single human, on this huge planet, that at the same time is tiny in the context of galaxies, universe, etc. And the point is, try to accept that this is the reality, not like this is some kind of a trick and someone else is hiding behind the next rock with a camera. No, you are the only living organism. Now&amp;hellip; Is there anything you want to do? You might get hungry, want to drink water, etc. But is there anything that you can do that is meaningful for you? Do you want to do math? Physics research? Chemistry? You might want to satisfy some personal needs or interests, but what&amp;rsquo;s the point of it?&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a hard question for me and the feeling was that I finally hit the ground of the ocean of questions and no matter what answer I come up with, I&amp;rsquo;ll build the rest on top of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My answer became that, no, there is nothing worth doing that is objectively valuable. My religious friends won&amp;rsquo;t agree with me on this whole experiment, as this concept in some way might be conflicting with some religious ideas, so sorry for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what this meant for me is that the whole definition of objective value makes it impossible and I have been pursuing a non-existent target for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This became the first answer that I could accept and not continuously question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, after this, the remaining concepts started building up.
So, objectively everything is meaningless.
Then, the whole definition of value and meaning is no longer objective, but rather these are concepts bound to the definition of society and other people and living organisms. Hence I need to find value and meaning that is related to the construct of society, rather than outside of it.
Now, this became the bottom of the questions tree, not really nodes in it, but rather the soil/ground where the tree stands.
After this, the whole &lt;a href=&#34;../the-why-in-life&#34;&gt;whys tree&lt;/a&gt; was built.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Simple Questions</title>
      <link>https://kostard.github.io/blog/2023/06/the-simple-questions/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 22 May 2023 22:01:00 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://kostard.github.io/blog/2023/06/the-simple-questions/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Throughout my life, I always liked discussing about the world, different philosophies and ideas, exploring and investigating new concepts, etc. And inevitably, I had several discussions when one of us felt misunderstood and we couldn&amp;rsquo;t come to a common ground. It&amp;rsquo;s so easy to fall into the spiral of continuous word picking, going into the details without agreeing on the fundaments and after hours getting out of it feeling like it was completely meaningless, possibly feeling hurt, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with time, I learned to be more present during the discussions and pay more attention to what&amp;rsquo;s happening and why are we derailing from the productive discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later I built a model that helps me to at least try to prevent these situations and if still not succeeding, at least stop it timely, letting both sides re-think and come back another time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For that, I am trying to break it down to &amp;ldquo;simple questions&amp;rdquo;. The term might be a bit misleading, as it&amp;rsquo;s not about avoiding the hard topics. But rather it&amp;rsquo;s about how we define questions and how we understand that we are not ready to answer other questions. The way one defines the questions should make sure that the terms and concepts used there are well defined. And the definitions used for the terms should rely on well-defined concepts as well. It&amp;rsquo;s worth mentioning that this probably can&amp;rsquo;t be perfect, at some point we can&amp;rsquo;t go much deeper, but at least we should try to have a good foundation and if we feel so, make it even deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example of a not simple question is: &amp;ldquo;Which is better, apples or pears?&amp;rdquo;
If we try to define the word better for ourselves, we&amp;rsquo;ll likely end up saying that it depends on the context and if something is better in one context, might be worse in another one. Hence, we need to guess what is the context of the question. It would be a good idea to ask clarifying questions, trying to make the original question simple, maybe it&amp;rsquo;s about your personal preferences from a taste perspective, maybe it&amp;rsquo;s part of an artwork and the question is which one fits better, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the common era, we are dealing with similar challenges with AI discussions. What does intelligence mean? What does self-awareness mean? What does it mean to be alive? How can you evaluate any of these from the &amp;ldquo;outside&amp;rdquo;?
It seems like we try to go into discussions about these topics without even trying to agree on the fundamental concepts. And I am not saying that it&amp;rsquo;s possible to find the right answers to these, but rather, I think we need to be open that we have a certain hypothesis or philosophy and we try to figure out if these are correct or not. Kind of having different schools of thought, allowing diversity, but also constructive discussions. This then can allow deeper discussions, possibly proving one of these to be wrong and moving closer to the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we use terms that even we don&amp;rsquo;t fully understand, we create risks that our minds will miss an important thought and lead us to mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;is-simplicity-subjective&#34; &gt;Is simplicity subjective?
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#is-simplicity-subjective&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partially. It relies on your current internal tree of concepts that you were able to define according to the mentioned constraints. But if another person has a similar set, you can have valid discussions, and build the missing pieces of each other&amp;rsquo;s trees to build the ground for the answer that will satisfy both of you. Hence, not everyone will directly relate, but if you share your tree, it will make more sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-do-i-mean-by-concepts-tree&#34; &gt;What do I mean by concepts tree
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-do-i-mean-by-concepts-tree&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concepts that we use for defining questions, stand on top of other concepts and are bound to them with questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-deal-with-questions-that-dont-yet-have-this-kind-of-simplicity&#34; &gt;How to deal with questions that don&amp;rsquo;t yet have this kind of simplicity?
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#how-to-deal-with-questions-that-dont-yet-have-this-kind-of-simplicity&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we feel that we are encountered with a question that does not have simplicity, one of the worst things we can do is to continuously try to answer it. We&amp;rsquo;ll end up in meaningless fights, debates about nothing, constant discussions going in circles, spend our energy and time, while not reaching any fundamental values. And next day, we&amp;rsquo;ll find another such question and entertain ourselves by trying to find answers that satisfy our ego, while making sure that others on the other side of things come up as wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But ignoring it might not be the best approach as well. I think the more optimal answer is somewhere in the middle. If we are encountered with a new question that we don&amp;rsquo;t feel the simplicity in, then we can try to look into it a bit, try to understand what&amp;rsquo;s the distance from our concepts tree, does it decompose to it. If the answer is no, check what is the missing part there. It might be the case that you are almost there to understand it, but something small is missing and you can just fill it. This is how I think we&amp;rsquo;ll be able to develop our concept trees. But if you feel that the grounds of the involved concepts are not in any way connected to the tree, then don&amp;rsquo;t even try to answer it. It might be the case that the concepts that the question involves are not even the right ones or come from trees that have very different fundamental nodes, hence you should not even try to answer them. You can keep these questions somewhere in your mind and revisit them in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;is-there-right-and-wrong-in-concepts&#34; &gt;Is there right and wrong in concepts?
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#is-there-right-and-wrong-in-concepts&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The whole definition of right and wrong in this context I believe comes from the fundamental nodes. A person who has different fundamental concepts will have very different motivations, moral values and definitions of a right concept.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Why in Life</title>
      <link>https://kostard.github.io/blog/2023/06/the-why-in-life/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 22 May 2023 21:58:55 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://kostard.github.io/blog/2023/06/the-why-in-life/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I believe everything we do in life should serve a tree of &lt;a href=&#34;../the-simple-questions&#34;&gt;simple questions&lt;/a&gt;, asking the &amp;ldquo;why&amp;quot;s of everything. Why do you want to do the thing you want? Why do you want to have a job? Rather than the easier answers like &amp;ldquo;Well I need money&amp;rdquo;, go deeper and build this tree defining who you really are. Why do you need money? What is your dream, why do you want that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you figure out how to build this tree and do it, everything or most of the things in your life will just start sticking into a bigger more structured picture, like pieces of a puzzle. The things that won&amp;rsquo;t fit will let you grow and improve your tree, as you&amp;rsquo;ll understand that something is wrong, so maybe somewhere in your whys tree you missed something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, worth mentioning that not everyone should have this model. I follow the Life Task definition of Robert Greene, hence your life&amp;rsquo;s task might be very different and the paths you need to take might be completely different from mine. But if you like aggregating knowledge, finding deep and hard answers once, then keeping the findings with you, looking for the next challenges, this approach might be a good fit for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-at-the-bottom-of-the-whys-tree&#34; &gt;What is at the bottom of the &amp;ldquo;why&amp;quot;s tree?
&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-at-the-bottom-of-the-whys-tree&#34;&gt;
        &lt;svg viewBox=&#34;0 0 28 23&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; width=&#34;19&#34; xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34;&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;path d=&#34;M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71&#34; fill=&#34;none&#34; stroke-linecap=&#34;round&#34; stroke-miterlimit=&#34;10&#34; stroke-width=&#34;2&#34;/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a challenging part. I think here at some point, no matter how persuasive you are, you need to decide to just stop and be satisfied with the depth you go. Because on the other end is the &lt;a href=&#34;../meaninglessness/&#34;&gt;meaninglessness&lt;/a&gt;.
So here we define some of the values that should align with our fundamental inner forces, culture, beliefs and goals. We can have some values that might be shared with more people, like &amp;ldquo;Continuing the development of humanity, while preserving and enriching the nature around us.&amp;rdquo;, but certainly there will be people with exact opposite goals, and that might be inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
