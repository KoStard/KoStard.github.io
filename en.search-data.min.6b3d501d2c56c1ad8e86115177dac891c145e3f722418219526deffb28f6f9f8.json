[{"id":0,"href":"/about/","title":"About","section":"KoStard's Home Page","content":"Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Ruben, and I\u0026rsquo;m a curious person who loves using philosophical ideas and answers to solve real-world problems. My moments of wonder have led me to study and use programming for these purposes (more than 5 years of professional experience).\nAs a Software Development Engineer at Amazon, I\u0026rsquo;m passionate about solving problems that matter and always looking for new challenges. I work on making cross-border expansion easier for our sellers and bringing more products to our customers.\nWhile I started as a self-taught programmer, I\u0026rsquo;m now graduating from the University of Luxembourg with a Bachelor\u0026rsquo;s degree in Applied Informatics. Currently, I\u0026rsquo;m learning everything I can find about the process of getting from an idea to a product, including product management, design, and business. I\u0026rsquo;m applying these ideas to my own projects, aiming to create a healthy development process without slowing down product development.\nI\u0026rsquo;m always happy to collaborate and learn with others, so if you\u0026rsquo;re interested in chatting about the development process or want to collaborate on a project, feel free to reach out to me. You can find me on LinkedIn and Twitter.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/tools/","title":"Tools I've made","section":"KoStard's Home Page","content":" Here you can find some of my tools: # Prices tracker for petrol and diesel in Armenia Armenian ANSI to Unicode translator OCR tool running inside your browser (supports Armenian) iTunes CLI Search "}]
